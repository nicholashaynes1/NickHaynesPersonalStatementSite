		<p>My latest work with community service was collecting water bottles for the shelter in Salt Lake. I ended up collecting over 500 cases of disposable water bottles. Prior to this while in my sophomore year of high school I was a part of my schools Stage Tech team as a lighting designer. During that time I would help to set up lighting for free for local acting troops, and town events, such as Herriman cityâ€™s 9/11 reembrace meetings. This was an event that took place at Herriman high with guest speakers like the mayor, or historians, and authors that I helped to run. </p>
