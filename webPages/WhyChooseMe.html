		<p>Simply put I am a hardworker. I learned how to work hard from an early age by being a boy scout, and now an Eagle scout. On top of working hard, I have a deep desire to do my personal best at whatever I try to acomplish. I think a good exapmle of me trying to do my best always, is my junior year of highschool. At the begining of my junior year I decided that my sophomore year was too easy, so I went to CTEC and ended up in the first class at the school to take a 2400 level college programming course. During my concurrent enrollment, one year at UVU and two years at SLCC, my grade never dropped below a 4.0.</p>
