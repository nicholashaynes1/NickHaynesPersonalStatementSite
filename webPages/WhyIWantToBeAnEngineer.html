<body>
	<p>I have wanted to be a programmer since I was about 8 years old, and played my first video game. After doing research on how video games were made, I saw how much there was to learn about programming and being a programmer. That relization that there was a sea of knowledge gave me a thirst to try and learn it all. My drive for being a programmer comes from a desire for knowledge, and the field of programming seems to have an endless wealth of new things to learn and try out.</p>
