		<p>Well immediately after I graduate I plan on taking a week or two before I begin my career as an official graduate I plan on doing some travelling. I would like to go to Africa with a non-profit or church group to help build housing and schools. I may go back to Cuba and do the same there, I am not quite sure yet. But long term I want to begin working as a professional full stack developer here in Salt Lake City. I have always loved Utah and want to help it grow to its full potential by working for local companies and making them nationally, or even internationally competitive with beautiful websites and a innovative ideas.</p>
