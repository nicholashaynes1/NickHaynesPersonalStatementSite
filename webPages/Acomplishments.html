	<p>I had touched on some of my accomplishments a bit earlier, but I will expand on them. My first major award I feel is worth mentioning is my eagle scout award. To rank up to eagle scout you must work hard earning merit badges by learning new skills, and acts of community service. Following the eagle scout award in chronological order I was on the honor roll from my sophomore till graduation in high school. While attending CTEC I was awarded the most professional programmer award. The award was given to me because out of all the students in the CTEC programming course my professor felt I had expanded my knowledge beyond what was required, or even what was being taught to us in a useful way. The last award worth mentioning is my advanced diploma I received for my good grades in high school.</p>
